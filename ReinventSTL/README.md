# Rebuilding the C++ STL from Scratch

## Overview
This project is a humble attempt to rebuild the core functionality of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ from first principles. While the actual STL implementations are highly optimized and complex, my goal here is to gain a fundamental understanding of how these structures and algorithms might work under the hood through a basic implementation using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features
- **Custom Implementations of STL Components**
  - Basic versions of Vectors, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Maps, Sets, and more
- **Object-Oriented Design Principles**
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **Iterators & Algorithms**
  - Simple iterator support for data structures
  - Basic Sorting, Searching, and Utility function
- **Memory Management**
  - Introduction to smart pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- **Exception Handling**
  - Basic error handling for STL-like operations

## Motivation
The STL is an essential part of modern C++, but many developers use it without understanding how it works internally. By reconstructing a very simplified version, I gain insights into,
- Fundamental memory management concepts
- Basic template metaprogramming
- Performance trade-offs of different data structures
- Principles of generic programming
